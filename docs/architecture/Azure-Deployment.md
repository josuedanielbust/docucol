# Azure Deployment Options for DocuCol

## Overview

This document outlines the available methods for deploying the DocuCol application to Azure. The architecture is designed as a containerized microservices system using Docker Compose for local development and provides several options for cloud deployment.

## Deployment Methods

### 1. Azure Container Instances (ACI)

**Description**: Azure Container Instances provides a simple way to run Docker containers in Azure without managing virtual machines or adopting a higher-level service.

**Best for**:
- Development and testing environments
- Simple applications with moderate scalability needs
- Short-running processes and jobs

**Implementation**:
- Uses Docker Compose CLI with ACI integration
- Simplest method with minimal configuration
- Limited scaling capabilities

**Deployment Script**: `services/scripts/deploy-to-aci.sh`

### 2. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

**Description**: AKS is a managed Kubernetes service that makes it easy to deploy and manage containerized applications using Kubernetes.

**Best for**:
- Production environments
- Complex applications requiring high availability
- Applications that need horizontal scaling
- Microservices architectures with multiple components

**Implementation**:
- Leverages existing Kubernetes manifests in `services/kubernetes/`
- Provides robust scaling, monitoring, and management
- Requires more configuration but offers better control

**Deployment Script**: `services/scripts/deploy-to-aks.sh`

### 3. Azure App Service

**Description**: Azure App Service is a fully managed platform for building, deploying, and scaling web apps, including support for Docker Compose files.

**Best for**:
- Applications that benefit from PaaS features
- Teams that prefer simplified management
- Services that need easy integration with other Azure services

**Implementation**:
- Uses Docker Compose for multi-container deployment
- Provides good balance of simplicity and features
- Includes built-in auto-scaling and load balancing

**Deployment Script**: `services/scripts/deploy-to-app-service.sh`

## Architecture Considerations

### Database Services

For production environments, we recommend using:
- Azure Database for PostgreSQL instead of containerized PostgreSQL
- Azure Cache for Redis instead of containerized Redis
- Azure Storage Account with Blob Storage instead of MinIO

### Messaging

For production environments, we recommend:
- Azure Service Bus instead of containerized RabbitMQ

### Storage

For production environments, we recommend:
- Azure Blob Storage instead of MinIO

## Deployment Decision Record

| Factor | ACI | AKS | App Service |
|--------|-----|-----|------------|
| Complexity | Low | High | Medium |
| Scalability | Limited | Excellent | Good |
| Management | Simple | Complex | Medium |
| Cost | Pay-per-second | Higher fixed costs | Medium fixed costs |
| DevOps Integration | Basic | Excellent | Good |
| Monitoring | Basic | Comprehensive | Good |
| Recommendation | Development/Testing | Production | Production (simpler) |

## Implementation Steps

1. Choose the appropriate deployment method based on your needs
2. Configure necessary environment variables
3. Run the corresponding deployment script
4. Verify the deployment using the Azure Portal or CLI tools
