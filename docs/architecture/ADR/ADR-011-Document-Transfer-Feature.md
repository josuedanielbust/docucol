# ADR-011: Document Transfer Feature

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-04-27

## Context
DocuCol needs the ability for users to transfer ownership of documents to other users in a controlled and auditable manner. This is particularly important for government-issued documents that may need to be shared between citizens or transferred to official entities.

## Decision
We will implement a document transfer mechanism within the Interop API that will:

1. Allow users to initiate document transfers to other users
2. Require explicit confirmation from recipients to accept or reject transfers
3. Maintain an audit trail of all transfer activities
4. Validate document ownership and user existence before permitting transfers
5. Update document ownership metadata when transfers are confirmed

## Rationales

1. **Security**: Requiring explicit confirmation prevents unauthorized transfers
2. **Audit Trail**: Maintaining a record of transfer activities supports compliance requirements
3. **User Experience**: A two-step process provides clarity and control for both parties
4. **Integration**: Leveraging the Interop API allows us to coordinate between document and user services

## Implementation

The feature will be implemented as a new module in the Interop API with these components:

1. **Transfer DTOs**: Define data structures for transfer requests and responses
2. **Transfer Service**: Handle business logic for initiating and confirming transfers
3. **Transfer Controller**: Expose REST endpoints for the transfer operations
4. **Integration**: Coordinate with Document API and Users API for validation and updates

The transfer process will have two distinct steps:
1. **Initiation**: Original owner requests transfer to another user
2. **Confirmation**: Recipient accepts or rejects the transfer request

## Consequences

### Positive
- Users can securely transfer document ownership
- Recipients have control over which documents they accept
- System maintains a clear record of all transfer activities
- Integrates with existing document and user management capabilities

### Negative
- Adds complexity to the system
- Requires coordination between multiple services
- Creates potential for orphaned transfer requests if not confirmed
- Additional data storage requirements for transfer records

## Security Considerations
- Verify document ownership before allowing transfers
- Ensure only the intended recipient can confirm transfers
- Validate user existence and permissions at each step
- Log all transfer activities for audit purposes

## User Experience
- Users need clear feedback on transfer status
- Recipients should receive notifications about pending transfers
- Interface should explain the implications of transfers
- Confirmation step should clearly communicate ownership changes

## Future Enhancements
- Add expiration for pending transfers
- Implement notifications for transfer status changes
- Support batch transfers for multiple documents
- Add delegation capabilities for organizational transfers
