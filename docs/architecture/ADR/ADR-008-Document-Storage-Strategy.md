# ADR-008: Document Storage Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The DocuCol system requires persistent storage for uploaded documents. These documents need to be securely stored, easily retrievable, and resilient to service restarts or container failures.

## Decision
We will implement a volume-based storage strategy for the Document API with the following characteristics:

1. A dedicated Docker volume (`document_uploads`) will be used to store all uploaded files
2. The application will access this storage through a configurable environment variable (`UPLOADS_DIRECTORY`)
3. The storage path will be consistent within the container (`/app/uploads`)

## Consequences

### Positive
- Document persistence across container restarts and redeployments
- Clear separation of application code and uploaded content
- Configurable storage location via environment variables
- Simplified backup and recovery processes
- Support for potential future migration to object storage

### Negative
- Additional volume to manage in the infrastructure
- Potential need for storage scaling considerations as document volume grows
- Need to ensure proper permissions on the volume mount

## Implementation Details
The Document API will use the `UPLOADS_DIRECTORY` environment variable to determine where to store uploaded files. This variable will be set to `/app/uploads` in the container, which will be mapped to a Docker volume called `document_uploads`. This ensures the files persist even if the container is destroyed or recreated.

## Security Considerations
- The volume should have appropriate permission settings
- File validation and sanitization must happen at the application level
- Monitoring of storage usage should be implemented
