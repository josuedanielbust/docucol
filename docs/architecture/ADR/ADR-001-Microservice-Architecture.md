# ADR-001: Adoption of Microservice Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2023-04-15

## Context
The DocuCol system needs to support a growing user base with increasing demands for reliability, scalability, and feature development. The team needs to decide on an architectural approach that will best support these requirements.

## Decision
We will implement DocuCol using a microservice architecture pattern rather than a monolithic approach.

## Rationales

1. **Scalability**: Each service can be scaled independently based on its specific resource requirements
2. **Development Velocity**: Separate teams can work on different services simultaneously
3. **Technology Flexibility**: Different services can use the most appropriate technology stack
4. **Resilience**: Failures in one service won't bring down the entire system
5. **Deployment**: Services can be deployed independently, allowing for more frequent updates

## Consequences

### Positive
- Teams can develop, test, and deploy services independently
- Services can be scaled based on specific demand patterns
- New technologies can be adopted for specific services without system-wide changes
- The system will be more resilient to failures

### Negative
- Increased operational complexity
- More complex testing scenarios
- Potential network latency between services
- Need for API gateway and service discovery mechanisms
- Data consistency challenges across services

## Alternatives Considered

### Monolithic Architecture
- Simpler initial development
- Easier testing
- No network overhead
- Rejected due to long-term scalability and development velocity concerns

### Serverless Architecture
- Minimal operational overhead
- Pay-per-use cost model
- Rejected due to concerns about cold starts and vendor lock-in

## Implementation Approach

1. Define service boundaries based on business capabilities
2. Implement API gateway as the entry point for all client requests
3. Use containerization (Docker) and orchestration (Kubernetes) for deployment
4. Implement service discovery and circuit breaker patterns
5. Use event-driven communication for asynchronous processes
