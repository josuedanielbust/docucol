# DocuCol Non-Functional Requirements

## Overview
This document outlines the non-functional requirements (NFRs) that the DocuCol system must satisfy. These requirements address system qualities rather than specific features or functions.

## Performance

### NFR-001: Response Time
- The system shall respond to user interactions within 300ms under normal load
- Document loading operations shall complete within 2 seconds for documents up to 10MB in size
- Search operations shall return results within 1 second for standard queries

### NFR-002: Throughput
- The system shall support at least 1000 concurrent users with no degradation
- The system shall support at least 10,000 document operations per minute

### NFR-003: Scalability
- The system shall be able to scale horizontally to support increased load
- The system shall accommodate storage growth of 5TB per year

## Reliability

### NFR-004: Availability
- The system shall have 99.9% uptime (less than 8.8 hours of downtime per year)
- Planned maintenance shall not count towards downtime if scheduled and announced 48 hours in advance

### NFR-005: Data Durability
- No data loss shall occur in case of system failure
- Document versioning shall prevent permanent data loss from user errors

### NFR-006: Disaster Recovery
- The system shall have a Recovery Point Objective (RPO) of 15 minutes
- The system shall have a Recovery Time Objective (RTO) of 4 hours

## Security

### NFR-007: Authentication and Authorization
- The system shall support single sign-on (SSO) integration
- The system shall implement role-based access control (RBAC)
- All authentication attempts shall be logged

### NFR-008: Data Protection
- All data in transit shall be encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher
- All data at rest shall be encrypted using AES-256
- The system shall comply with GDPR, CCPA, and other relevant data protection regulations

### NFR-009: Security Testing
- The system shall undergo penetration testing before each major release
- Static code analysis shall be performed as part of the CI pipeline

## Usability

### NFR-010: Accessibility
- The web interface shall conform to WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards
- The system shall support screen readers and keyboard navigation

### NFR-011: Internationalization
- The user interface shall support multiple languages
- The system shall handle documents in various languages and character sets

## Maintainability

### NFR-012: Code Quality
- Code shall follow industry-standard style guides
- Code coverage for unit tests shall be at least 80%

### NFR-013: Documentation
- API endpoints shall be documented using OpenAPI Specification
- System architecture shall be documented following the C4 model

## Operational

### NFR-014: Logging and Monitoring
- All system errors shall be logged with appropriate context
- The system shall provide real-time monitoring dashboards
- The system shall alert administrators of critical issues

### NFR-015: Deployment
